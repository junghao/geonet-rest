Materialized (qrt.quake) versus the unmaterialized view.

Command line testing (note diff in count is expected and caused by event outside the NZ region)

[geoffc@localhost alert-quake-ng-localities]$ time psql -c "select count(*) from qrt.quake;" hazard hazard
 count 
-------
 4450
(1 row)


real	0m0.018s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.005s



[geoffc@localhost alert-quake-ng-localities]$ time psql -c "select count(*) from qrt.quake_unmaterialized;" hazard hazard
 count 
-------
  4451
(1 row)


real	0m3.717s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.004s


There is some possibilty that the region selects may need materializing eventually.  Testing against the 
current number of rows seems fine.  The only potential gain would be not having to execute the ST_Contains.


time psql -c "select count(*) from qrt.quake where ST_Contains((select geom from qrt.region where regionname = 'wellington'), origin_geom) limit 30;" hazard hazard
 count 
-------
    92
(1 row)


real	0m0.023s
user	0m0.001s
sys	0m0.003s
